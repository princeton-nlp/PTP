class SpanMaskingGenerator:
    """
    Generator class that yields span masks

    Args:
        num_patches (`int`):
            The total number of images patches
        num_masking_patches (`int`, defaults to 1):
            The number of patches to be masked out. Typically determined by the masking ratio
        max_span_length (`int`, defaults to 6):
            The maximum number of consecutive masked patches
        spacing (`Union[int, str]`, default to 0):
            The number of non-masked patches in between consecutive masked spans. Can either be an integer value,
            in which case the spacing is fixed, or can be set to "span" in which case the spacing is dynamic such
            that on both sides of a masked span of length N patches, there will be N non-masked patches. Note that
            larger spacing makes it harder to greedily sample masks satisfying these constraints which can slow down
            masking and also cause the algorithm to terminate with a smaller mask than specified. In case of the
            latter, PIXEL randomly masks additional patches until the specified masking ratio is reached.

            These are the recommended settings:
             - For masking ratio <= 0.4 use "span" mode.
             - For ratios between 0.4 and 0.7 set spacing to 1.
             - For higher, set spacing to 0
